# Hi, I'm Spirast 👋

### Fullstack Roblox Developer
**3 Years Luau** | **2 Years TypeScript**

<br />

I specialize in professional fullstack development using an external workflow with **Rojo**, **Wally**, and **VS Code**. My primary focus is engineering systems that are **readable**, **clean**, and **modular**.

### 🔧 Development Philosophy
I believe that code should be as easy to read as it is to write. Whether I am scripting in strict **Luau** or strictly-typed **roblox-ts**, I prioritize:
*   **Modularity:** Decoupled systems that scale using **Wally** packages.
*   **Cleanliness:** Linted, formatted, and efficient code.
*   **Readability:** Logic that future maintainers can understand immediately.
