## About Me
Hello! My name is Spirast, and I am a passionate Lua scripter based in Las Vegas with one year of dedicated experience in scripting. Currently, I am mastering the use of Knit, a lightweight framework for Roblox, and seamlessly integrating it into my workflow to improve efficiency and maintainability. My proficiency extends to using Rojo, allowing for more organized and scalable development.

I rely on Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my primary code editor, which significantly enhances my efficiency and productivity. Additionally, I have become well-versed in Git and GitHub, ensuring efficient version control and smooth collaboration on all my projects.

Beyond technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and always eager to tackle new challenges. Whether itâ€™s developing innovative game mechanics or optimizing existing systems, I strive to deliver high-quality results.
