### 🔧 Development Philosophy
i think that all code should be ez af to read when im finished with it
*   **Modularity:** when u add shit itll be so ez u will glaze me for it
*   **Cleanliness:** when u look at my code, itll never look like its being held up by hopes and dreams, nah itll be held up by steel and encased in diamond
*   **Readability:** when u read thru my code it will be ALL over the screen when ur done reading it
