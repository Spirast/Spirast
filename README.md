# üëã Hello, I'm Spirast!

## Coding Style
**Should you wish to examine the structure and implementation of my code, navigate to the section below this README.md or on the top left, select repositories, select any repository of interest, and explore the "src" directory. Additionally, I may periodically publish a .rbxm release; therefore, I encourage you to also review the releases section.**

## üéÆ Roblox Luau Developer

I am a dedicated Roblox developer with two years of experience in designing and implementing interactive experiences utilizing the Luau programming language. My expertise lies in developing efficient and maintainable code structures for Roblox games and associated systems.

### Programming Languages
- **Luau**: Advanced proficiency demonstrated over a period of two years.
- **Lua**: Strong comprehension of fundamental language constructs and features.

### Development Environment
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Primary integrated development environment (IDE) utilized, equipped with extensions specifically tailored for Roblox development.
- **Rojo**: Proficient in employing Rojo for the synchronization of external codebases with Roblox Studio.
- **Git/GitHub**: Utilized for version control and collaborative software development.
- **Pesde**: Experienced in package management for Roblox project dependencies.

## üîß Technical Expertise

- **Game Systems Development**: Expertise in architecting robust and scalable systems for game functionality.
- **User Interface Programming**: Skilled in the design and implementation of responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
- **Performance Optimization**: Proficient in writing code aimed at maximizing efficiency for enhanced gameplay smoothness.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Competent in structuring maintainable class hierarchies and abstraction layers.
- **Memory Management**: Adept at implementing strategies to prevent memory leaks and optimize resource utilization.

## üöÄ Workflow

My typical development workflow involves:

1. **Planning & Architecture** - Designing systems before implementation
2. **Local Development** - Coding in VSCode with Roblox LSP for intellisense
3. **Rojo Integration** - Syncing code to Roblox Studio for testing
4. **Version Control** - Regular commits and proper branching strategies
5. **Package Management** - Using Pesde to incorporate external libraries
6. **Testing & Optimization** - Ensuring performance and stability
